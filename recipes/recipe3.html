    <h3>Ingredients</h3><br>
    <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
      <li>2 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped</li>
      <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <h3>Directions</h3><br>
    <ol style="margin-left:20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>Start by tossing your fresh strawberries into a saucepan along with the sugar and the fragrant vanilla bean seeds. Set it over medium heat and let them mingle until the strawberries soften and the sugar dissolves beautifully. Once it's all mixed up, take it off the heat and allow it to cool—your kitchen will smell heavenly!</li>
      <li>In another saucepan, gently heat the heavy cream and whole milk until it just starts to simmer. The creamy goodness will make your mouth water. Once it simmers, remove it from the heat and set it aside.</li>
      <li>Grab a bowl and whisk the egg yolks until they're nice and smooth. Now, the fun part! Gradually pour that warm cream mixture into the bowl with the yolks while whisking constantly. You're creating a luscious custard base!</li>
      <li>Pour the custard back into the saucepan and cook it over low heat, stirring constantly until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Be patient—it's worth it!</li>
      <li>Strain the custard into a bowl to get rid of any lumps, then let it cool down. Once it's cool enough, pop it in the fridge to chill until it’s cold and dreamy.</li>
      <li>Now comes the best part: churning! Pour the custard into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. When it's almost done, add in that gorgeous strawberry mixture to swirl in all that fruity goodness.</li>
      <li>Finally, transfer the ice cream to a container and freeze it until it's firm. Once frozen, scoop, serve, and savor every delicious bite of your homemade treat! Enjoy!</li>
